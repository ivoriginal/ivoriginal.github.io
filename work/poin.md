### **The client**: Two Bad Motherfounders

In 2019, **Angelica and Nazareth** were tired of going to restaurants with their kids only to find out that they had a "no kid policy". They assumed that some day Google Maps and Foursquare would help them find out about those kind of places before going, but... how long would they have to wait?

Having previously worked at companies such as Groupon, eltenedor and Ticketea, they both had plenty of experience in helping people find what they need, so they rolled up their sleeves and founded Motherfounder SL, the company that would eventually give birth to POiN Places. Its mission: **make life with kids easier**.

### **The product**: POiN Places

**POiN Places is Google Maps for parents**. It lists restaurants, parks, etc. using Google Maps' API, adding a new layer of crowdsourced data, based on parents reviews: does this restaurant have adapted toilets? Play zone? If it's a museum, does it have activities for kids?

And that's exactly the other core feature of POiN: activities. It's an aggregator of activities for families, and you can book both activites and tables directly from POiN. The first version looked like this:

![Old POiN screenshots]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_old-screenshots.png)
*POiN's MVP was like [the football player](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi)*

This MVP was built on top of WordPress and various other services, and though it was useful, the interaction and the performance was far from ideal. The layout was inconsistent, and adding new modules or features made everything even more complex. The search experience was messy, two, and competition was far ahead (in terms of brand perception and product design), so they picked up the phone and called yours truly.

### **The reason**: convenience, inspiration, participation

The objective was to position POiN as an **ally for urban parents**. We'd have to craft an storytelling that explained what POiN was, what could you achieve by using it and also inspired people to discover places and to write reviews. The core of the product was **the data generated by its users**, so finding ways to invite parents to  review places would be our priority number one. Number two would be making the "add new place" action obvious and accessible.

That initial information architecture design resulted in an unclear product structure and navigation. It wasn't obvious what could you do in POiN, or how and where to find places. The places section was very different from the activities section. It didn't inspire trust, and it wasn't easy to use at all.

### **The process**: working side by side with business and development

At that point, the team was just Angelica (sales) Nazareth (marketing) and Irene (development). We worked together to establish the foundations of a system to build and iterate the new POiN. Irene was working on a new back-end to (among other things) make the search experience easier for the user, and the architecture for the new front-end was still a big question mark.

#### Getting everyone on the same page

The team was using doing almost everything on **Notion** and **Miro**, so that'll be our shared workspace. The team listed all the elements that they considered important to include in our new components and voted. They did this asynchronously and transparently, so I could read their rationale and design the right hierarchy.

*Notion: our shared workspace*

Miro helped us to **group activities** into wider categories and to discuss how the search feature should work.

</div>

Before designing the actual information architecture, we came up with a list of things that we'd like to cover:

- **Home** ("Discover")
	- The first thing you should see is the map
	- Carrousel with curated content
	- Link to activities (€!)
	- Sign up <s>form</s>
	-	Explain "poin points" 

- **Places**
	- Search + filters
	- Place view with/without activites
	- Save places (*save for later* vs *like*)

- **<s>Login</s>**
	- <s>Login page</s>
	- <s>My account</s>
	- <s>My places</s>
	- <s>My reservations</s>

- **General**
	- <s>About us</s>
	- <s>FAQ</s>
	- <s>Benefits </s>
	- B2B page → B2B module
	- <s>Legal</s>

#### The front-end

I suggested, as I usually do in cases like this, to **start using some third party library** that helped us build the UI as fast as possible: it cuts the design costs and makes implementation way easier, leaving more time for me to work on the bigger picture and not just on the *small* details like the states for the buttons.

Also, you can easily find Material Design UI libraries for Sketch and Figma, so it was just a matter of adapting those pre-made components to the brand guidelines.

#### The competition (benchmarking)

Before starting to design menus and sections, we took a look to what our competition was doing. 

- **Sawyer** is a marketplace of activities for kids operating in the USA. Key inspo: online specific section since COVID.
- **Hoop** was an app that helped families discover activites with their kids. Key inspo: playful visual identity (oriented to *both* parents and kids?)
- **Kidelp** is a marketplace for child-friendly businesses. Key inspo: operating as middleman, search menu readily available.

Outisde *parentech* we reviewed searching and filtering systems by **Airbnb**, **Tripadvisor**, **Yelp** and **Michelin**.

### **The (re)design**

#### The first drafts

The POiN team was looking for something fresh and new, and we had few technical limitations at that moment (everything was going to be brand new). Because I understood that *browsing* was more important than *searching*, I drafted a new interaction model that relied very heavily on the map.

Those big and colorful chips were filters that took you to the search page, and with a swipe (or a scroll) you'll see popular places around you.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_first-draft.png)
*POiN 2.0 first draft*

I also wanted to keep the development as simple as possible using a side menu on desktop that is more or less **as wide as a mobile screen**, but as soon as we started working on the place view, it was pretty clear that this layout wasn't going to work. A friend that faced a similar problem back in the day at Spotahome told me to run away from maps, as they are the seventh circle of interaction hell.

#### The iteration

I abandoned that initial exploration and crafted a new navigation that would allow users to **get to know the brand and the product on the same page**: the *Discover* page. They could see the value proposition, search and browse curated places and activities.

![New POiN structure]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_info-arq.png)

This new version took the user straight to Discover, but they could navigate to Places and Activities from the fixed navbar; and even if a user ignores the navbar, Places and Activities were accessible through the modules on Discover.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_discover.png)

The main actions (*search* and *add missing place*) were also in the navbar, which in smaller viewports was positioned at the bottom of the screen, turning the *add missing place* action into a FAB. We reserved a spot for future additions like the B2B module (for companies that wanted to promote themselves on the platform)

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_B2B.png)

I'll take more about the responsiveness of these components in [the design system section](#the-design-system).

#### Search and filter

*Search* was undoubtfully **the hardest part** of this project. The Activities feature was running on top of a bunch of different services, and it was going to stay like that for a while, so the Search feature would work only with the Places database. 
We designed it keeping in mind that, in the near future, **you could search in both *Places* and *Activities*** from the *Discover* page, but for the first release, it'll take you to the Places page after confirming a query.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_search.png)

Of course, each page had its own search bar, so that left us with **two different search interactions**.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_search-2.png)

In the Discover page we had the search bar extension with all the filters collapsed as chips (an idea I started playing around with while building the [Community Directory]({{site.baseurl}}/work/gfs-directory)), but in the Places page they were part of the layout. Why hide them? We had plenty of space.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_filters-1.png)

Note: we'll talk about the different card explorations in [the design system section](#the-design-system)

Moving on. That left us with **three** different filtering interactions: as dropdown menus on Discover, as a fixed side column in Places and as a full-width view on mobile.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_filters-responsive.png)

...and that's why we built the filters as modules.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_filters-2.png)

They already had this amazing age selector component (up, right) that we decided to keep (with a few small improvements)

#### The place page

Since the competition benchmarking phase we were obsessed with the Airbnb place page. It looked stunning, but... we don't had hi-resolution media to pull off a full width layout that looked great. Not even acceptable. Airbnb is a platform where people upload pictures to *seduct* other people to stay in their properties. They have a vested interest on uploading high quality pictures. 

If you spend a few minutes browsing through Google Maps, you'll see that most of pictures are really bad. Even if someone has a smartphone with a great camera, without proper photography skills, their pictures will still look amateur-ish.

That said, I tried to design a layout that didn't rely too much on user generated content.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/work/poin/poin_ficha-2.png)

The CTA for this page was *reserve now*, because affiliate reservations are one of the main things that bring money to the business. Here's the mobile version:

Save and share.

#### Navigation & responsiveness

The navigation bar

If they didn't notice the navigation bar, they could access those other sections from the Discover modules.
