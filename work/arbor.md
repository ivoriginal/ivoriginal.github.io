I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholassalguero">Nicholas Salguero back in 2018</a>, right after he and his team finished the <a href="http://www.letshackity.com/en/design-sprint-school-startups/">Tetuan Valley + Hackity Design Sprint</a> with a brand new prototype of a fintech app called Arbor. 

He told me that the problem was very clear: people in Spain don't save enough money. After living in USA & LATAM for a while and inspired by other personal finances services like <a href="https://www.acorns.com/">Acorns</a>, he decided to build a platform to help people save and provide enough financial education to turn some of that savings into investments.

#### What the hell does "compound interest" mean?
