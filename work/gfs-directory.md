Your first day at a <strong>co-working space</strong> is pretty much like your first day of school. Usually there's someone that explains to you the schedule, the rules and where you can pee. 

You know that you have to take your own stuff (say books, say laptop) and some money for food, but as soon as you get there you start realising that you don't know anyone and your life as a co-worker is gonna be pretty miserable if you don't fix that asap.

If you're lucky enough to get accepted into one of Google for Startups campuses, you'll be surrounded by founders, amazing technical people and so on, so you'll want to meet as many people as possible while your –typycally six months– membership lasts.

#### Turning informal knowledge into actionable insights

<a>Carlos</a> and I have been part of the Madrid community for 5+ years, so we basically know everyone. When the campus team started wondering how they could help people connect inside the community, they didn't take long to notice that we might have some insights on that.

We had a lot of informal knowledge, but this was the perfect chance to organise it; we built a simple script and a list of topics that we wanted to understand better, and we kickstarted a round of interviews.

#### Unknown unknowns

We soon realised that the main problem when trying to integrate is that you don't know what you don't know. If you randomly talked with Carlos, he'll ask you about your background and find good matches for you. If no one tells you to talk to a connector like Carlos, you'll probably be isolated.

We also found out that the main driver to look for new connections was asking for help with a certain tool or technology (say Mixpanel or Python), but if you haven't met at least one technical profile, who should you ask for help? 

Here we found the first feature for what'll eventually become the Community Directory: search by skill, not by name.

#### Searching is a mess

I need help with/I offer help with. Lo de los quick filters.

#### Datalytics

After the initial pilot, it went well. The contract. A global product.
