#### Let robots do it

I was born in [an island](https://unsplash.com/photos/BghGseQbAkA) 652 km away from Morocco to Elisabetta and David, two spaniards with really mediocre cooking skills and a questionable taste in names (Ivo? Really? How do you even pronounce that?)

It was a matter of time that they decided to send me with my grandparents, Susana and Giorgio,  with unbeatable cooking skills and much better taste in names, to be raised in [a godforsaken region](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murcia) of southeastern Spain.

*Young Ivo and granpa (what a cutie!)*

My granpa still tells with a thick neapolitan accent –despite having spent most of his life in Spain– that, when I was 4, I decided that <strong>I wanted to build robots</strong>. My reasoning was something in the lines of this:

> In the future, robots will do all the work, so the only reasonable profession to pursue is to build and repair robots (until they repair themselves!)
–<i>Young Ivo, 1998</i>

<!-- (Yes, I'm quoting myself. This is <i>my</i> website, isn't it?)

<br> -->

I spent part of my youth wondering if I was a visionary, but as I grew older, I started to figure out that the underlying reasoning behind that affirmation might be that I've never actually wanted to work (let robots brew your coffee and so on). The thing is that <strong>I've always enjoyed creating stuff</strong>. 

Sadly, my math skills have been way below average since I can remember, so robotics never seemed like a viable option. Neither did architechture or software engineering, so I decided to pursue a creative career.

#### Is <i>show business</i> one word or two?

I started shooting short films with my friends when I was 15, and after taking a brief production course in the world famous University of Murcia, in 2012 we released a webseries called <strong>LevelUp!</strong>

We were broke, so we followed the <i>lean startup</i> philosophy three years before learning what the hell that was: that camera belongs to CAMON (God bless you, guys). I learned to do some graphic design while editing the videos (and rotoscopy, After Effects, sound production, scriptwriting...), and thanks to that I got some design jobs with local businesses.

At some point, people started recognising us in the streets, so I decided to cold mail as much YouTube partners as one could find. "It's time to start a business", I guessed. It looks like lots of fun, doesn't it?

I don't really know if I did think that this show was way better than it was, or I was just comparing it to a really poor competition, but as you can imagine, this was not a great business idea. Nevertheless, I packed up my stuff and moved to Madrid to see what's that show business all about.

Somehow I managed to sign with the same partner as the biggest hit at the moment, Malviviendo, but I didn't want to face that my peers were not as engaged as I was with that project. At the end of the day, I did all the pre and post work; for me, it was <i>our</i> future, but for them it was just a fun thing to do on the weekends, so things started to get colder as soon as I left and we eventually stopped shooting.

#### What the hell is a startup, anyways?

Mingling with the local <i>youtubers</i> in the city led me to a job in a eSports production studio that somehow combined the two things I did best at that moment: producing video and designing stuff for videos. There I met Sean, a software engineer student and ex-youtuber who soon would become my co-founder.

I didn't know a single thing about the startup world, but this guy was so driven by his idea that we eventually dropped university and went full on with it: <a href="gamify"><strong>Gamify</strong></a> was a social network where you could turn into achievements every single thing you did, like skydiving or getting your college degree.

According to Gartner, gamification was one of the hottest topics at that time, so... I guessed it made sense to adapt the classic garage entrepreneur story to our context: I was living in a flat with a shared patio, so that'd be our garage.

Building Gamify I learned about product design and development, HTML and CSS, a little bit of JavaScript, customer success, community building, user research, Mixpanel, Unbounce, InVision, Sketch, team building, digital marketing and to deal with influencers (and engineers!)

We were accelerated by <strong>Tetuan Valley</strong> and joined the <strong>Google for Startups</strong> community. At some point, we assembled an amazing team of two product designers (Carolina and Hekady), three developers (Gonzalo, Carlos and Mencey), one communicator (another Carlos–everyone in Spain is called <i>Carlos</i>, fyi), one accountant (Javi) and one filmmaker (Satu). 

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16gTCYtD5UA&feature=youtu.be" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

We also had this amazing intern called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-penner-b534a8143/">Jared</a> who now is a big boss at Amazon or something like that.

Gamify connected people from many different places, and we still have contact with some of our very early testers; we met amazing people and started long-lasting friendhips, but we didn't have the expertise to turn it into an actual business. Eventually, we had to pull the plug and move on to the next adventure.

#### Currywurst mit pommes

The coolest thing we did with Gamify was signing up for the Spacehack, a hackathon organised by Facebook in Berlin to help syrian refugees that arrived in Europe with the infinite problems that they faced (and face) when they arrive to Europe asking for asylum.

I fell in love with the city, and after closing Gamify in 2017, I moved there to work with <strong>Mensch</strong>, a video production company with a social focus. We did some pretty cool stuff, I learned a lot from senior managers like Ruha and joined the Factory community, where I had the chance to join the Design Circle in its very first days of life.

Soon I realised that I was in some kind of transition state, and that I didn't really want to live in that city and/or pursue that lifestyle. When Carlos and I started spending some time in the evenings thinking about new projects to build together, I also realised that I missed my friends and my family, and that I wanted to pursue the path of the maker, whatever that was.

#### <i>Personal finances</i> sounds way more boring that what it really is

Soon after moving back to Madrid, I received a few job offerings from my newtork, but I didn't really know what I wanted to do (besides being able to pay rent and eating and so on). After having a very interesting conversation with Nicholas Salguero, I decided to join him at Arbor, a fintech company commited to help "the 99%" to save more money and learn to invest.
