#### A family tradition

Building interfaces since 1812

I was born in [an island](https://unsplash.com/photos/BghGseQbAkA) 652 km away from Morocco to Elisabetta and David, two spaniards with really mediocre cooking skills and a questionable taste in names (Ivo? Really? How do you even pronounce that?)

It was a matter of time that they decided to send me with my grandparents, Susana and Giorgio,  with unbeatable cooking skills and much better taste in names, to be raised in [a godforsaken region](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murcia) of southeastern Spain.

*Young Ivo and granpa (what a cutie!)*

My granpa still tells with a thick neapolitan accent –despite having spent most of his life in Spain– that, when I was 4, I decided that <strong>I wanted to build robots</strong>. My reasoning was something in the lines of this:

> In the future, robots will do all the work, so the only reasonable profession to pursue is to build and repair robots (until they repair themselves!)
